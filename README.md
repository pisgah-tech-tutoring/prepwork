# Pisgah Tech Tutoring - Prep Work

This is a short list of recommended videos, articles, and courses you should complete before the course.  Why?  Because it gives you the best chance for success.  You WILL still have questions after studying these materials, that's okay!  Questions about a topic are better than no awareness of the topic at all.

You will also need to set up accounts/programs for a couple websites (they're all free) that we will use along the way.  If you run in to any problems with these, no worries, just let us know. Please have your accounts set up for these before the first class!
