# Pisgah Tech Tutoring - Prep Work

This is a short list of recommended videos, articles, and courses you should complete before the course.  Why?  Because it gives you the best chance for success.  You WILL still have questions after studying these materials, that's okay!  Questions about a topic are better than no awareness of the topic at all.

So give these a go, take notes on what you find interesting or confusing and reach out along the way!
